## Inspiration
Sought to create a more streamlined app for water operators in Calgary. We were inspired to create a better website for the Water movement by implementing interactive features. 

## What it does
Houses relevant videos, provides an option for chatting with others to request help and a method to connect to other water operators.

It is an online interactive platform  where Indigenous operators  can  connect  with each  other  and  with Subject  Matter  Experts  to  find  specific  equipment training,  determine  how  to troubleshoot  issues  and share  lessons learned.​

Water Movement provides this online platform which has ​a User friendly interface​ with these features :

1. Video library to train and educate the operators 
2. Operators can view videos by category​
3. Operators can download videos from the videos page to view it offline​
4. Collaboration Zone to create an online community for Indigenous Water operators across Canada​
5. Youth zone to bridge the connection between students and the water sector​
6. We can use the disccusiion forum​ to post videos/ photos/ texts in the collaboration zone 
7. Operators can connect with each other through messaging​
8. Operators can create a personal account and save all the personal info in an offline version 
9. Students can view upcoming events and attend them using the events tab
10. Operators can ask question and answer them in the Discussion forum​

## How we built it
We built ur website using With django, HTML and CSS. We used Github to save our project.
1. The backend of our web application was built using Django framework from the python library.
2. We integrated html and CSS inside our framework in order to built a fully functional web application. 
3. We created advanced functionality of the user authentication, ensuring the security of the web application and connecting video uploads from the operator to the front end of our web application using Django , html , CSS. 

## Challenges we ran into
1. Working in different timezones and coming to terms 
2. Minor bugs and errors in the HTML page 
3. Obtaining the chat function for the website
4. Facing several constraints coding for our back-end 
5. Issues of connecting the front-end with the back-end was a challenge. However, we were successful in overcoming them.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
1. We learned HTML and CSS in 2 days
2. Learning django, html and css much better thorugh self motivation
3. We created a website from scratch 
4. A greta learning experience

2. How to create web application 
3. How to handle frustrating debugging moments

## What's next for Water-Movement-YYC-Helper

2. Expanding our database for the videos age
